jOWL is a [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugin for navigating and visualising OWL-RDFS documents.

  * [jOWL Demo's](http://jowl.ontologyonline.org)
  * [jOWL Documentation](http://jowl.ontologyonline.org/documentation.html) - expressed as an OWL-DL file and visualised with jOWL.


Latest release: 1.0

I also added a package called jOWLBrowser.zip. This package contains additional html files and css files that, in conjunction with the latest jOWL release, can be used to quickly set up a generic OWL-DL ontology browser.
